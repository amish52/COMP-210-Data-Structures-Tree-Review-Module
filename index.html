  Hello COMP 210 students! 

</h3>
  <h4> Introduction: </h4>
<p>
  Over the semester, we have noticed that many students have been struggling with their knowledge of the different types of trees we've studied in class. Since this is a large portion of the content in this course, we have decided to create a short module that will serve as a review for the different types of trees that we have studied. These include:
</p>
  <p>
      <li>Binary Search Trees (BSTs)</li>
      <li>AVLs</li>
      <li>Red-Black Trees (RBTs)</li>
    </p>
  <h4> Goal: </h4>
  <p>
    The end goal of this module is for students to become more familiar with the different types of trees and their specifc rules. Students should be able to follow directions provided related to insertions and deletions and format the correct tree.
